      <h1>Privacy Policy for Mockey Patcher Chrome Extension</h1>
      <p><strong>Last Updated: August 12, 2024</strong></p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Mockey Patcher ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy
        Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use
        our Chrome extension.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
      <p>
        The Mockey Patcher extension does not collect any personal information that you directly
        provide to us.
      </p>

      <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
      <p>When you use our Chrome extension, we may collect the following information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Network Requests</strong>: The extension captures HTTP/HTTPS requests made by
          websites you visit for the purpose of mocking API responses. This includes URLs, request
          headers, and response data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mock Configurations</strong>: Any mock configurations you create within the
          extension are stored locally in your browser's storage and optionally in the backend
          database if you choose to use it.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain the functionality of the Mockey Patcher extension</li>
        <li>To enable the creation and management of mock API responses</li>
        <li>To improve and optimize the extension's performance and user experience</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Storage</h2>
      <p>The Mockey Patcher extension stores data in the following ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Local Storage</strong>: Most data is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's
          Storage API. This data does not leave your device unless you explicitly choose to export
          it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Backend Database</strong>: If you choose to use the backend service, mock
          configurations may be stored in a database that you control. The backend service is
          self-hosted, meaning you have full control over where and how this data is stored.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We do not share your data with any third parties. All data captured by the extension remains
        on your device or within your self-hosted backend service.
      </p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable measures to help protect your information from loss, theft, misuse,
        unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no method of
        electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Since all data is stored locally on your device or in your self-hosted backend, you have
        complete control over your data. You can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>View all data stored by the extension through the Chrome DevTools</li>
        <li>Delete any or all data through the extension's interface</li>
        <li>Clear all extension data through Chrome's extension management interface</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by
        posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
      </p>
